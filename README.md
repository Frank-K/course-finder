# Build Upon - Course Finder
A course finder that suggests upper year courses that build upon your other courses.  
This is done by searching the prerequisites of upper year courses and finding the ones that are satisified.

## Motivation
Finding new courses to take is hard. You have to go through the course calendar, look by department and verify that you have the prerequisites for each individual courses. I made Build Upon to simplify this process. With Build Upon you no longer have to spend time searching through the course calendar. Build Upon will show you courses that you are able to take based on the ones that you have already taken.
